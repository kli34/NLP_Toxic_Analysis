Each time i've written it, copied, pasted, sent, and it's gone through without an edit conflict notice, I've closed the program, and then it's LOST. Then I write a NEW reply with the new eidts accounted for, and that's gone. Good night.   \\n\\n :The problem is that the 'edit conflict' screen doesn't occur.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE write them up in another program, like Word, Spellcheck, proofread, THEN cut n paste in. Three times between you and Markovich. I want to help you convince him, but now i'm pissed and going to bed instead of replying. Each time i've written it, copied, pasted, sent, and it's gone through without an edit conflict notice, I've closed the program, and then it's LOST. Then I write a NEW reply with the new eidts accounted for, and that's gone. Good night.   \\n\\n :The problem is that the 'edit conflict' screen doesn't occur. Instead, it shows me the page, but my comments are just LOST. it's truly frustrating.

But as former spouses don't use to be called \"\"former girlfriends\"\" (although they mosly are), in this case \"\"ex\"\" must be meant in the sence of \"\"ex girlfriend\"\". As however the user in question declares, that this ex girlfriend still is \"\"a very dear friend of me\"\", things are becoming very complicated.  \\n\\n Anyway, the question is, whether there are reliable sources of the statement, that somebody can become the jewish ethnicity, just by being somebody elses girlfriend, and if yes, how long that relation, according to those sources has to last, before the change in ethnicity takes place. Another question is, in how far the obtained ethnicity disappears again, when that relation comes to an end. \\n\\n Talking about reliable sources; indeed one can say, that pictures can only be used as a proove of somebody belonging to a certain people or race, in case in reliable sources criteria have been mentioned, that are dicisive in that respect.  \\n Alas it seems, that finding these sources  might take more time, than this user has available for this, to him marginal, matter. In the little time he had available, he found this:  \\n , but that may be not quite, what the search was for. Maybe others have more time available.

Keep it up.  \\n\\n == the grilling u gave me == \\n\\n wtf r u on about, i dint vandalise bams page, i dint even change nethin, so syop pointin the blame to me when it was probably your shortsightedness or stupidness. \\n\\n bk off \"\"Jackass\"\" (pun intended)  \\n\\n == Re: parsol thing == \\n\\n It's a line from Citizen Kane, specifically the scene where Thompson goes to interview Mr. Bernstein, who starts talking about memory.   \\n\\n == quilt photo == \\n\\n Hi, I was wondering what happened to your quilt photo? The link is still there, but there is no picture showing up... \\n Quilt   |    \\n :Hmmm... wierd. seems to be a browser specific glitch... shows up in Safari but not Camino... Beautiful quilt BTW. Made by someone you know?   |    \\n\\n == Skateboarding (Third Generation) edit == \\n\\n Hey, just wondering, why did you cut the text about street skating from the third generation section of the skateboarding article?  It's certainly flawed, and certainly unsourced (like much of the article), but something needs to go there to explain the evolution of street skating in the 80's.  I put a section about this on the talk page if you want to discuss, or leave a note on .  Thanks.   \\n\\n == Ethnic Cleansing == \\n\\n Hello, I wanted to complain about it because it is a shocking game which goes agaisnt evrybody's morals. Not only is it offensive, it is poorly made, making even more a pathetic excuse to go agaisnt black people and Jewish people. Racism is a terrible, terrible part of human nature which is worng, so I'm sorry if this sounds a bit rude, but I, as a citizen of the worls, have a rite to complain about this pointless game. Thanks.  \\n\\n == Change to UPS user box == \\n\\n Liface, \\n\\n Thanks for the suggestion. I just added \"\"the\"\" into the UofPStudent user box. -   \\n\\n == Hey == \\n\\n Hey, did you ever get the skateboarding project into the stellarsphere? If you ever need help with blocks or other admin stuff for violators of CKY (or any) pages just let me know...    \\n\\n == GAAP == \\n\\n I am a CPA and I think that the EIFT is important becasue it played such an integral part in the Enron scandal when debt was placed in special purpose entities, SPEs, that were named for Star War characters.  How long have you been a CPA.  It is 23 years for me.  What reason would you delete the EITF. Do you understan GAAP?  I think that anybody wondering about GAAP, which would probably be non-CPAs, should know this little-known fact.  \\n\\n == GBStv AFD == \\n\\n I've nominated a page you have editted for Deletion: Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/GBStv_%28second_nomination%29   \\n\\n == Image:Gbskevin.jpg listed for deletion == \\n An image or media file that you uploaded or altered, Image:Gbskevin.jpg, has been listed at Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion. Please look there to see why this is (you may have to search for the title of the image to find its entry), if you are interested in it not being deleted. Thank you. — User:Ceyockey ('''')  \\n\\n ==Quilt photo== \\n\\n What happened to your quilt picture? It seems to have dissappeared from the database. \\n\\n \\n\\n == Pioneer Square help == \\n\\n Can you please, please help with what's going on at Pioneer Courthouse Square? I am sick and tired of dealing with it myself. I'm supposed to be on vacation here.

Normally when you get profanity used by one player against another, it's from, how shall I say, rather more marginal players. \\n *Miller specifically stuck around till the end of the game to air his grievances to the media, despite suffering a concussion. \\n *It ties into the larger issue of Lucic in particular and then Bruins in general (cf. Chara-Pacioretty) having a reputation for thuggery. \\n *It's rare for such damning words to be spoken to media regarding another player. Normally there's at least a pretense of civility.

Real third party evidence is provided: a BBC4 article clearly discusses the RADIO and TV appearance. I hope Snowed is not supported by moderators  in claiming that the youtube videos are forgeries, since Peter Power himself does refer to them and never claims them to be fakes. Clearly the subject is also relevant because Mr Power and BBC4 were compelled to issue lenghty, repeated statements (that make the TV appearance seem even stranger). As to personal attack: Do you think that anything that reflects negatively on a Person must be expunged from Wikipedia? I am simply reporting a well known fact (recorded!) that makes one think. Since when does wikipedia think for it's readers? To revert my edits with the unsubstantiated(!) \"\"conspiracy theory\"\" allegation as rationale is a clear violation of a fundamental Wikipedia principle NPOV. Peter Power may or may not be a decent human being, this is not for us to decide, rather we should let facts speak.  Snowed! If you still think that I am peddling a \"\"conspiracy theory\"\" I urge you to look at the precise wording of my insert. If someone feels that the wording hints at a hidden agenda, I must remind you that the hidden agenda is in the TV appearance of Peter Power itself. In light of grave violation of wikipedia principles I wish this topic to be discussed urgently and my edits be reinstated immediately by Snowed.   \"</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>462</th>\n      <td>IT IS USERS LIKE YOU THAT MAKE WIKIPEDIA A SHITHOLE.

If this event is covered later in the article then it is that section needs to be removed.  Secondly, note the italic part of the sentence above, can Wikipedia say that this event triggered response (ban) from the Chinese government?  I don’t think we know enough to say that.    \\n\\n == Image:Buying Tickets.png == \\n Thanks for uploading Image:Buying Tickets.png. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please: \\n\\n # Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template. \\n # On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all. \\n\\n Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself. \\n\\n If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  ''''''  \\n\\n == A new approach to the Falun Gong article == \\n\\n Hello Colipon, please see the Falun Gong talk page and state your opinion about my proposal concerning a strict source policy. I think it's worth serious consideration. You know that the situation is tense, so we really need to find a common set of rules that is absolutely fair to all parties. In my opinion, the three-strike rule requires too much devotion to Wikipedia, and thus discriminates against a large group of editors. -  \\n\\n ==SEZs== \\n http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:SEZ&diff;=104756759&oldid;=103785732 The first four SEZs are not, even until present day, not co-exist with the city limits.

My (brief) experience on Wikipedia has confirmed the fact that it's a time-sink and there are a lot of fucking idiots who will type any bullshit into it, then play their little games to make sure their shit stinks. As long as retards like that NeilN twat abound here, it's a foregone conclusion that facts will always take a backseat to smear and lies. Given all that, there's NO FLOCKING WAY I will bother getting an account; this has been a very bad experience for the most part. The small part that hasn't been bad was seeing you standing up for the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and not to let trial by media become the standard of justice in this country. Best wishes and have a good life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\n       racism_x  Pred_racism_x  Pred_racism_y  \n105    0         0              1              \n119    0         0              1              \n138    0         0              1              \n158    0         0              1              \n184    0         0              1              \n...   ..        ..             ..              \n63591  0         0              1              \n63629  0         0              1              \n63743  0         0              1              \n63753  0         0              1              \n63869  0         0              1              \n\n[1502 rows x 4 columns]",

I'm giving as an anachronism a reference to a historical event (the abandonment of clerical celibacy by the Roman Catholic Church) in which a character finds a 1990 newspaper that refers to the \"\"wife of the Pope\"\" having children. Such would not happen for at least 24 years after the time suggested in the newspaper.   \\n\\n Nobody says that this movie is orthodox science fiction (note that tobacco and junk food have been found wholesome and organic foods have been found harmful in an Orwellian world), but a reference to a 1990 event that is shown to be impossible because a prediction of an institutional change that does not happen for a significant time later becomes an anachronism after 1991.   \"</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>184</th>\n      <td>Being drunk made Gibson say what he really believes.

If this event is covered later in the article then it is that section needs to be removed.  Secondly, note the italic part of the sentence above, can Wikipedia say that this event triggered response (ban) from the Chinese government?  I don’t think we know enough to say that.    \\n\\n == Image:Buying Tickets.png == \\n Thanks for uploading Image:Buying Tickets.png. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please: \\n\\n # Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template. \\n # On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all. \\n\\n Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself. \\n\\n If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

The holocaust is basically when millions of Jews were murdered during WWII and were intensely discriminated by Hitler and the Nazi’s. However many of the Jews had resided in parts of Europe and many of them were residing in Germany but many of them were once again murdered by the Germans because Hitler plotted on disappearing all the Jews that were in the country.  This reminds me of how Ms. Gruwell from freedom writers encouraged her students to learn and investigate about the Holocaust because not all of them knew about it or even believed it even happened and she wanted them to have confidence and knowledge about it that way they can become intelligent with the history of the event. But some people never believed that the holocaust existed and others actually did.  \\n\\n Therefore, a network of over 40,000 facilities in Germany and occupied territory and was used to concentrate, hold and kill Jews and other victims. In addition after the beginning of WWII, the Nazi’s began ordering Jews to live in certain areas of the cities in where many of them weren't allowed to leave at all. Also many of the Jews were held prisoners and had to be forced out of their residing locations and follow the orders of the Nazis or they will have to face death, but the Jews faced death anyways and about 5 million children were also killed during the holocaust due to Hitler’s orders. Also the first victims of the holocaust were homosexuals and people with disabilities and these victims were one of the first to be murdered during the event and there were also approximately more than 5 million non-Jewish victims living in Germany during WWII and as we said before the majority of them had to evacuate their places and relocate different areas. In addition there were different kinds of camps such as ghettos, concentration camps and even extermination camps where all the Jews were sent and were never free from any of the camps, and the majority of all Jews had to suffer being trapped in these places where they would be tortured and harmed intensely and later on face death due to their residence in the country where they weren't respected and treated kindly by the Germans and especially Hitler. Also the Jews were the scapegoats of Germany collapsing after WWI meaning that the Nazi’s blame the Jews for the damage that has occurred to the country and Germany wanted to gain more power in order for them to become a more powerful strong country. \\n\\n Anne Frank Diary \\n\\n Anne Frank was a young girl that wrote every detail in a diary in her life of the Holocaust. She was sending a message to everyone or to whom that finds the diary. I believe that she had a messenger, to tell her what was going on outside. Anne Frank was born in June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany. She was born as a Jew, and bringing a Jew was a very bad thing in the 1920’s because it was during World War I. She was hiding because herself and her family didn't want to get killed so the hide for a while in a tiny place. I don’t understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family, that didn't do anything wrong? Why hurt the Jews? What did they do to get killed? \\n\\n Change of the Freedom Writers \\n\\n Should It’s amazing how the Toast of Change of the Freedom Writers has succeeded. From a group of students who didn't care about school and becoming someone important in life, to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same. Most of the Freedom Writes shared the same story. They didn't care about school; they only care about surviving another day in Long Beach without getting killed. Most of the Freedom Writes are teachers now in the area of Long Beach. Many of them graduated from colleges, others are part of the Freedom Writers Foundation. They should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in High School. The reason why, is because it was then when it all started. From failing, ditching class, gang violence, poverty, and other domestic violence at home, to SUCCESS. For the most part, most of them are doing very well. They are teachers, professors and other important positions someone can have. They are living the toast of change. \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n Links \\n http://www.firststreetconfidential.com/images/images-history/0921-the-holocaust.jpg \\n http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/ \\n http://images.publicradio.org/content/2009/08/12/20090812_anne_frank_33.jpg \\n http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=5438</td>\n      <td>Topics \\n • \\t The Holocaust \\n • \\t Anne Frank Diary \\n • \\t Change of the Freedom Writers \\n\\n The  Holocaust  \\n\\n The holocaust occurred during World War II when Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany.

I don’t understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family, that didn't do anything wrong? Why hurt the Jews? What did they do to get killed? \\n\\n Change of the Freedom Writers \\n\\n Should It’s amazing how the Toast of Change of the Freedom Writers has succeeded. From a group of students who didn't care about school and becoming someone important in life, to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same. Most of the Freedom Writes shared the same story. They didn't care about school; they only care about surviving another day in Long Beach without getting killed. Most of the Freedom Writes are teachers now in the area of Long Beach. Many of them graduated from colleges, others are part of the Freedom Writers Foundation. They should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in High School. The reason why, is because it was then when it all started. From failing, ditching class, gang violence, poverty, and other domestic violence at home, to SUCCESS. For the most part, most of them are doing very well. They are teachers, professors and other important positions someone can have. They are living the toast of change. \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n Links \\n http://www.firststreetconfidential.com/images/images-history/0921-the-holocaust.jpg \\n http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/ \\n http://images.publicradio.org/content/2009/08/12/20090812_anne_frank_33.jpg \\n http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=5438</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>166</th>\n      <td>jack dion really bikes karly so much he wants to do a jamiw on her</td>\n      <td>jack dion really bikes karly so much he wants to do a jamiw on her</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>190</th>\n      <td>**Well, I agree, basset hounds are highly overrated, and they smell bad too.</td>\n      <td>**Well, I agree, basset hounds are highly overrated, and they smell bad too.</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>198</th>\n      <td>\" \\n :I think the MOTD is a waste of time. / \"</td>\n      <td>\" \\n :I think the MOTD is a waste of time. / \"</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>265</th>\n      <td>. \\n\\n :::What makes you think being old is going to help stop a smoking addiction?
